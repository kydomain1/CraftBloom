        <p>CraftBloom participates in affiliate marketing programs and may receive commissions on purchases made through links on our Website. We also publish sponsored content from time to time.</p>

        <p>The materials on CraftBloom's Website are provided on an "as is" basis. CraftBloom makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>In no event shall CraftBloom or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on CraftBloom's Website, even if CraftBloom or an authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.</p>

        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

        <h2>Product Recommendations and Reviews</h2>
        <p>Product recommendations, reviews, and comparisons on our Website represent the opinions of our writers and editors based on their research and testing. Your individual results may vary.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>Our Website may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by CraftBloom. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services.</p>

        <p>You acknowledge and agree that CraftBloom shall not be responsible or liable for any damage or loss caused by your use of any third-party websites or services.</p>

        <h2>Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless CraftBloom and its licensees and licensors from and against all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, or debt, and expenses arising from:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Your violation of any term of these Terms</li>
            <li>Your violation of any third-party right, including intellectual property rights</li>
            <li>Any harmful content you submit to the Website</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and access to the Website immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including breach of these Terms.</p>

        <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Website will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may contact us at hello@craftbloom.com.</p>

        <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time at our sole discretion. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice before any new terms take effect.</p>

        <p>By continuing to access or use our Website after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

        <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.</p>

        <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
        
        <h3>Informal Negotiations</h3>
        <p>To expedite resolution and reduce costs, you and CraftBloom agree to first attempt to negotiate any dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating formal proceedings.</p>

        <h3>Arbitration</h3>
        <p>If informal negotiations fail, you and CraftBloom agree that any dispute arising out of these Terms will be resolved through binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in court.</p>

        <h3>Class Action Waiver</h3>
        <p>You and CraftBloom agree that any proceedings will be conducted on an individual basis and not as a class action, consolidated proceeding, or representative action.</p>

        <h2>Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>

        <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and CraftBloom regarding the use of the Website and supersede all prior agreements and understandings.</p>
